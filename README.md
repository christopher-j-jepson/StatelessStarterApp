   ## Functional Description
   
      The Stateless Starter Web Application incorporating Spring-Boot, an MVC, REST w/ JSON, 
      built with Gradle, free of XML configuration, coded on Java 10, and designed to be 
      deployed on Apache Tomcat. It is a work-in-progress, but is set as a milestone for
      demonstration purposes only.
      
      Currently, the following will work with limitations:
      
      # RESTful Webservices:
      
        - MVC: As intended (XMLless).
        - GET: As intended.
        - POST: As intended for CREATE and PROCESS REQUEST
